Right Triangles

Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides 
each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) 
should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

Examples:

triangle(5)

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
triangle(9)

        *
       **
      ***
     ****
    *****
   ******
  *******
 ********
*********

def triangle(n)
number_of_spaces = n - 1
number_of_asterisks = 1 
loop do 
  break if number_of_asterisks >= n
  puts "#{' ' * number_of_spaces} #{'*' * number_of_asterisks}"
number_of_spaces -= 1
number_of_asterisks += 1
end
end  

input - number
output - triangle of * that starts with 1 and (n-1) spaces and then adds a * each time and subtracts one from
number_of_spaces
