You are given a method named spin_me that takes a string as an argument and returns a string that 
contains the same words, but with each word's characters reversed. Given the method's implementation,
 will the returned string be the same object as the one passed in as an argument or a different object?

def spin_me(str)
  str.split.each do |word|
    word.reverse!
  end.join(" ")
end

spin_me("hello world") # "olleh dlrow"

# The returned string will not be the same string that was passed into it.

# However, as soon as we have converted string into an array by calling split method on it, 
# it is no longer possible for us to get back original object again. Even just doing str.split.join(" ") 
# returns a different object since you are splitting the string into an array and then joining that array 
# back into a new string, with the same sequence of characters but still, a different object.
