What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
array2 = []
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
puts array2

Moe
Larry
CURLY
SHEMP
Harpo
CHICO
Groucho
Zeppo

Once the two arrays are link in the first block, any changes that are done to array1 will also be reflected in array2.
In this case that means making Curly, Shemp, and Chico all uppercase in the output.
