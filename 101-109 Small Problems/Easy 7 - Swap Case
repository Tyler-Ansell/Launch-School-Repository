Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string in which every uppercase letter 
is replaced by its lowercase version, and every lowercase letter by its uppercase version. 
All other characters should be unchanged.

You may not use String#swapcase; write your own version of this method.

Example:

swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'

def swapcase(string)
  new_string = string.chars.map do |char|
    if char =~ /[a-z]/ then char.upcase!
    elsif char =~ /[A-Z]/ then char.downcase!
    else
      char
  end
end 
new_string.join
end
