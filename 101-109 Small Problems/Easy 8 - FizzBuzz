Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number.
 Print out all numbers between the two numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", 
 if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Example:

fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz


def fizzbuzz(startnum, endnum)
  result = []
  (startnum..endnum).map do |number|
     if number % 5 == 0 && number % 3 == 0
        result << "FizzBuzz"
    elsif number % 5 == 0
        result << "Buzz"
    elsif number % 3 == 0
        result << "Fizz"
    else
        result << number
    end
end
print result.join(', ')
end
