Write a method that takes an Array of numbers, and returns an Array with the same number of elements, 
and each element has the running total from the original Array.

Examples:

running_total([2, 5, 13]) == [2, 7, 20]
running_total([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]) == [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
running_total([3]) == [3]
running_total([]) == []

def running_total(array)
  sum = 0
  array.map { |value| sum += value }
end


input array

output array of the running total of the input array

rules
output array has the same number of elements as the original array

data structure
array

method
going to need to iterate through the first array
while iterating will need to add the value to the right (an index position higher than the one to its left)
  to the value to the left in the array
  that will need to be returned as a value in the new array and the process will have to be repeated
  until the array has been entirely iterated through
